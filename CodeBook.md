The original dataset from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
and described at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
contained 3-axial linear acceleration and angular velocity data sampled in a fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec.
Data were collected from 30 volunteers performing six activities.  

The measurements summarized in this analysis are the mean and standard deviation over the sampling window of the X-axis,
Y-axis, Z-axis, and magnitude of the linear acceleration and angular velocity of the subjectâ€™s body.  These values are
corrected for gravity, observations of which are also included in this summary.  In addition, observations of the Jerk,
or change in acceleration with time, are included in this summary.  In some cases the original study included a frequency
from a Fast Fourier Transform.  These values are also summarized.

All of these details of the original study are described in the above link.  

This analysis script summarizes each of these variables by computing the average for each subject for each activity.
The columns of the summary data set are:

Subject : integer identifying the person studied for this observation
Activity : the activity engaged in for this observation
           possible values are: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING
